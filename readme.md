### Dengue
Dengue fever is a viral infection that is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. It can cause high fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, and bleeding. In some cases, it can lead to severe complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which can be fatal. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for dengue fever, so the best way to prevent it is to avoid mosquito bites. This can be done by wearing protective clothing, using insect repellents, sleeping under mosquito nets, and eliminating mosquito breeding sites by draining stagnant water and applying insecticides. Dengue fever is a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and early diagnosis and supportive care are essential to reduce the risk of death. Dengue fever has four different types of viruses, and once a person is infected by one type, they develop immunity to that type but not the others. This means that a person can get dengue fever up to four times in their lifetime. The second or subsequent infections are more likely to be severe and cause complications. Therefore, it is important to monitor the symptoms and seek medical attention if they worsen. Some of the signs of severe dengue are abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding from the nose or gums, blood in the stool, fatigue, restlessness, cold or clammy skin, and a weak pulse. These indicate that the blood vessels are leaking and the blood pressure is dropping, which can lead to shock and organ failure. Severe dengue requires hospitalization and intensive care, and may involve blood transfusion and intravenous fluids.
