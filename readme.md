### Dengue
Dengue fever is a viral infection that is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. It can cause high fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, and bleeding. In some cases, it can lead to severe complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which can be fatal. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for dengue fever, so the best way to prevent it is to avoid mosquito bites. This can be done by wearing protective clothing, using insect repellents, sleeping under mosquito nets, and eliminating mosquito breeding sites by draining stagnant water and applying insecticides. Dengue fever is a major public health problem in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and early diagnosis and supportive care are essential to reduce the risk of death. Dengue fever has four different types of viruses, and once a person is infected by one type, they develop immunity to that type but not the others. This means that a person can get dengue fever up to four times in their lifetime. The second or subsequent infections are more likely to be severe and cause complications. Therefore, it is important to monitor the symptoms and seek medical attention if they worsen. Some of the signs of severe dengue are abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding from the nose or gums, blood in the stool, fatigue, restlessness, cold or clammy skin, and a weak pulse. These indicate that the blood vessels are leaking and the blood pressure is dropping, which can lead to shock and organ failure. Severe dengue requires hospitalization and intensive care, and may involve blood transfusion and intravenous fluids.
### The Padma bridge
The Padma Bridge is a remarkable engineering feat that connects the southwest region of Bangladesh with the rest of the country. It is a two-level road-rail bridge that spans 6.15 km across the Padma River, the main distributary of the Ganges. The bridge was inaugurated on 25 June 2022 by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who called it the “Bridge of Dreams”. The Padma Bridge is expected to have a significant impact on the social and economic development of Bangladesh. It will reduce travel time and cost, increase trade and commerce, improve access to education and health care, and create new opportunities for employment and tourism. The bridge will also facilitate regional connectivity and cooperation with neighboring countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan. The Padma Bridge is a symbol of national pride and achievement for the people of Bangladesh. It is a testament to their resilience and determination to overcome challenges and pursue their aspirations. The bridge is also a tribute to the vision and leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who made the project possible despite facing many obstacles and controversies. The Padma Bridge is not just a physical structure, but a bridge of hope and harmony for the nation.
